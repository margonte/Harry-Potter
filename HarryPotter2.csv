Harry;I can’t let you out, Hedwig. 
Harry;I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. 
Harry;Besides, if Uncle Vernon…
Vernon;HarryPotter!
Harry;Now you’ve done it.
Petunia;He’s in there. Vernon...
Vernon;I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go.
Harry;But she’s bored! 
Harry;If I could only let out for an hour or two
Vernon;Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
Harry;But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.
Dudley;Who’d want to be friends with you?
Vernon;I should think you’d be a little more grateful. 
Vernon;We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Petunia;Not now, Pupkins. For when the Masons arrive.
Vernon;Which should be any minute! 
Vernon;Ahem...Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? 
Vernon;Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be...?
Petunia;in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
Vernon;Good! And- and Dudley, you will be...?
Dudley;I’ll be waiting to open the door!
Vernon;Excellent! ...And you...?
Harry;I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist.
Vernon;Too right, you will. 
Vernon;With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. 
Vernon;And you will not mess it up!
Vernon;Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Dobby;Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! 
Dobby;HarryPotter! Such an honor it is!
Harry;Who are you?
Dobby;Dobbysir, Dobbythe house elf.
Harry;Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
Dobby;Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobbyunderstands! 
Dobby;It’s just that, Dobbyhas come to tell you- it is difficult, sir
Dobby; Dobbywonders where to begin?
Harry;Why don’t you sit down?
Dobby;S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? 
Dobby;Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho... Oh, ho, ho.
Harry;Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! 
Harry;I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
Dobby;Offend Dobby? 
Dobby;Dobbyhas heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
Harry;You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Dobby;No, I haven’t. 
Dobby;That was an awful thing to say. 
Dobby;Bad Dobby!
Harry;Stop, Dobby!
Dobby;Bad Dobby!
Harry;Dobby, shh!
Dobby;Baaad Dobby!
Harry;Dobby, please stop!
Vernon;Ohh, don’t mind that! 
Vernon;It’s just the cat.
Dobby;Bad Dobby. 
Dobby;Bad Dobby!
Harry;Stop! Stop, Dobby. 
Harry;Please be quiet! 
Harry;Are you all right?
Dobby;Dobbyhad to punish himself, sir. 
Dobby;Dobbyalmost spoke ill of his family, sir.
Harry;Your family?
Dobby;The wizard family Dobbyserves, sir. 
Dobby;Dobbyis bound to serve one family forever. 
Dobby;If they ever knew Dobbywas here...ooh... 
Dobby;But Dobbyhad to come. 
Dobby;Dobbyhas to protect HarryPotter- to warn him. 
Dobby;HarryPotter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! 
Dobby;There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
Harry;What terrible things? 
Harry;Who’s plotting them?
Dobby;Ooo... er... can’t... say... argh...
Harry;Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
Dobby;Don’t make me talk, I— Errr...
Harry;Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down.
Dobby;Bad Dobby.
Harry;Give me the lamp! Dobbystop!
Dobby;Let me go!
Harry;Get in there, and keep quiet!
Vernon;What the devil are you doing up here?
Harry;I- I was just—
Vernon;You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Harry;Sorry.
Vernon;One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! 
Vernon;And fix that door!
Harry;Yes, sir... See why I’ve got to go back? 
Harry;I don’t belong here. 
Harry;I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. 
Harry;It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
Dobby;Friends who don’t even write to HarryPotter?
Harry;Well, I expect they’ve... been- hang on- 
Harry;how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?
Dobby;HarryPotter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. 
Dobby;Heh- Dobbyhoped, if HarryPotter thought his friends had forgotten him, HarryPotter might not want to go back to school, sir.
Harry;Give me those, now!
Dobby;No! Ahh! Ooh...
Harry;Dobby, get back here!
Harry;Dobby, please, no!
Dobby;HarryPotter must say he’s not going back to school!
Harry;I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
Dobby;Then, Dobbymust do it, sir, for HarryPotter’s own good. 
Vernon;...it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. 
Vernon;And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” 
Vernon;A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”
Vernon;I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed. 
Vernon;Meeting strangers upsets him. 
Vernon;That’s why I kept him upstairs!
Vernon;You’re never going back to that school. 
Vernon;You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Ron;Hi, Harry!
Harry;Ron! Fred. George. 
Harry;What are you all doing here?
Ron;Rescuing you, of course. 
Ron;Now, come on. Get your trunk!...
Ron;You’d better stand back. Let’s go!
Petunia;Oh!
Vernon;Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!
Dudley;Dad! What’s going on?
George;Go, go, go, go!
Dudley;Dad, hurry up!
Ron;Come on.
Fred;Come on.
Ron;Come on, Harry! Hurry up!
Vernon;Petunia, he’s escaping!
Harry;Ahh- ahh!
Ron;I’ve got you Harry!
Vernon;Come here!
Harry;Let go of me!
Vernon;Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!
Harry;Get off!
Ron;Drive!
Fred;Right.
George;Right!
Vernon;No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Aunt Petunia & Dudley  ;Aaah!
Dudley ;Dad!
Vernon;Oh... Damn.
Ron;By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday!
Fred;Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! 
Fred;Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on.
Ron;Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
George;Yeah, Mum would never know.
Ron;It’s not much, but it’s home.
Harry;I think it’s brilliant
Mrs. Weasley;Where have you been? 
Mrs. Weasley;Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. 
Mrs. Weasley;Beds empty! No note! Car gone!
Mrs. Weasley;You could have died! You could have been seen! 
Mrs. Weasley;Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear.
Ron;They were starving him, Mum. 
Ron;There were bars on his window!
Mrs. Weasley;Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!  
Mrs. Weasley;Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast.
Mrs. Weasley;Here we are Harry. 
Mrs. Weasley;Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go.
Ginny;Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
Mrs. Weasley;Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Harry;Hello. W-what did I do?
Ron;Ginny. She’s been talking about you all summer.
Ron; A bit annoying really.
Mr. Weasley;Morning, Weasleys.
Fred, George, Ron ;Morning, Dad.
Mrs. Weasley;Morning Arthur!
Mr. Weasley;What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Harry;Raids?
Ron;Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. 
Ron;Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating.
Mr. Weasley;Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Harry;Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter.
Mr. Weasley;Good Lord! Are you really? 
Mr. Weasley;Well, Ron’s told us all about you, of course.
Mr. Weasley;When did he get here?
Mrs. Weasley;This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Mr. Weasley;Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
Fred, George, Ron, Harry ;Oh, it...
Mrs. Weasley;Arthur!
Mr. Weasley;I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys. 
Mr. Weasley;Very wrong of you
Mr. Weasley;Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. 
Mr. Weasley;Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?
Harry;Oh, umm...
Mrs. Weasley;Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. 
Mrs. Weasley;Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?
Percy;Errol...
Ron;He’s always doing that.
Percy;Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. 
Percy;And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well.
Mr. Weasley;Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. 
Mr. Weasley;Doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
Mrs. Weasley;Oh, no.
Fred;This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. 
Fred;The spell books alone are very expensive.
Mrs. Weasley;We’ll manage. 
Mrs. Weasley;There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. 
Mrs. Weasley;Diagon Alley.
Mrs. Weasley;Right.
Mrs. Weasley;Here we are, Harry.
Mrs. Weasley;You go first, dear.
Ron;But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.
Harry;Floo powder?
Mrs. Weasley;You go first, Ron, so that Harrycan see how it's done. Yes.
Mrs. Weasley;In you go.
Mrs. Weasley;That's it.
Ron;Diagon Alley.
Mrs. Weasley;You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Mrs. Weasley;Don't be afraid. Come on.
Mrs. Weasley;Come on.
Mrs. Weasley;In you go. That's it.
Mrs. Weasley;Mind your head.
Mrs. Weasley;That's right.
Mrs. Weasley;Now, take your Floo powder.
Mrs. Weasley;That's it, very good.
Mrs. Weasley;Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
Harry;Diagonally.
Mrs. Weasley;What did he say, dear?
Mr. Weasley;Diagonally.
Mrs. Weasley;I thought he did.
Mr. Borgin;Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you again. 
Mr. Borgin;If I may, just in today --
Lucius Malfoy;I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
Lucius Malfoy;But selling.
Mr. Borgin; Selling?
Lucius Malfoy;You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids. 
Lucius Malfoy;There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act...
Lucius Malfoy;I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call.
Lucius Malfoy;Certain poisons and the like...
Mr. Borgin;Hmmm... yes. I see...
Draco;Can I have this?
Mr. Borgin;Ah, the Hand of Glory. 
Mr. Borgin;Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder. 
Mr. Borgin;Best friend of thieves and plunderers. 
Mr. Borgin;Your son has fine taste, sir.
Lucius Malfoy; Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
Lucius Malfoy;Though if his marks don't pick up --
Draco; It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. 
Draco;That Hermione Granger --
Lucius Malfoy;I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
Mr. Borgin;It's the same all over. 
Mr. Borgin;Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
Lucius Malfoy;Not with me.
Lucius Malfoy ;Very good. 
Lucius Malfoy ;I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. 
Lucius Malfoy ;Come, Draco.
Witch;Not lost, are you, my dear?
Harry;I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...
Witch;Come with us. 
Witch;We'll help you find your way back.
Harry; No. Please...
Hagrid; Harry?
Harry;Hagrid!
Hagrid;What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
Hagrid;You're a mess, Harry. 
Hagrid;Skulking around Knockturn Alley? 
Hagrid;Dodgy place.
Hagrid;Don't want no one to see you there.
Hagrid;People will think you're up to no good.
Harry;I was lost, I...
Harry;Hang on.
Harry;What were you doing down there then?
Hagrid;Me? I was... 
Hagrid;I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Hagrid;They're ruining all the school cabbages.
Hermione;Harry. Hagrid.
Hagrid;Hello, Hermione.
Hermione;It's so good to see you.
Harry;It's great to see you too.
Hermione;What did you do to your glasses?
Hermione;Oculus Reparo.
Harry;I definitely need to remember that one.
Hagrid;You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Hagrid;Right. I'll leave you to it.
Hermione;Okay, bye.
Harry;Thank you. Bye.
Hermione;Come on, everyone's been so worried.
Mrs. Weasley;Harry.
Mrs. Weasley;Thank goodness.
Mrs. Weasley;We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
Mrs. Weasley;Ohh, Here he is.
Ron;Mum fancies him.
Photographer;Make way there, please.
Photographer;Let me by, madam. Thank you.
Photographer;Excuse me, little girl.
Photographer;This is for the Daily Prophet.
Gilderoy Lockhart;It can't be. HarryPotter?
Photographer;HarryPotter!
Photographer;Excuse me, madam.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Nice big smile, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Together, you and I rate the front page.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.
Gilderoy Lockhart;When young Harrystepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me…
Gilderoy Lockhart;which, incidentally, is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list
Gilderoy Lockhart;he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works free of charge.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Now, ladies?
Mrs. Weasley;Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.
Mrs. Weasley;All of you wait outside.
Mrs. Weasley;That's it Ron.
Draco;I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?
Draco;Famous HarryPotter.
Draco;Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page.
Ginny;Leave him alone.
Draco;Look, Potter.
Draco;You've got yourself a girlfriend.
Lucius Malfoy;Now, now, Draco, play nicely.
Lucius Malfoy;Mr. Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
Lucius Malfoy;Forgive me.
Lucius Malfoy;Your scar is legend.
Lucius Malfoy;As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
Harry;Voldemort killed my parents.
Harry;He was nothing more than a murderer.
Lucius Malfoy;You must be very brave to mention his name.
Lucius Malfoy;Or very foolish.
Hermione;Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
Lucius Malfoy;And you must be Miss Granger.
Lucius Malfoy;Yes, Draco has told me all about you. 
Lucius Malfoy;And your parents.
Lucius Malfoy;Muggles, aren't they?
Lucius Malfoy;Let me see.
Lucius Malfoy;Red hair, vacant expressions tatty, secondhand book.
Lucius Malfoy;You must be the Weasleys.
Mr. Weasley;Children, It's mad in here.
Mr. Weasley;Let's go outside.
Lucius Malfoy;Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
Mr. Weasley;Lucius.
Lucius Malfoy;Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?
Lucius Malfoy;I do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this, I'd say not.
Lucius Malfoy;What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?
Mr. Weasley;We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
Lucius Malfoy;Clearly.
Lucius Malfoy;Associating with Muggles.
Lucius Malfoy;And I thought your family could sink no lower.
Lucius Malfoy;I'll see you at work.
Draco;See you at school.
Mr. Weasley;10:58, come on.
Mrs. Weasley;The train will be leaving any moment.
Mrs. Weasley;Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! 
Mr. Weasley;Fred, George, Percy, you first.
Mrs. Weasley;Okay.
Mr. Weasley;After you, dear.
Mrs. Weasley;Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry.
Harry;Let's go.
TRAINMASTER;What do you two think you're doing?
Harry;Sorry.
Harry;Lost control of the trolley.
Harry;Why can't we get through?
Ron;I don't know.
Ron;The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.
Harry;The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
Harry;We've missed it.
Ron;Harry, if we can't get through maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
Harry;Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron;The car.
Harry;Ron, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
Ron;Aaa, Right.
Ron;Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.
Harry;Come on, then. Let's go lower.
Harry;We need to find the train.
Ron;Okay.
Harry;All we need to do is catch up with the train.
Ron;We can't be far behind.
Harry;Do you hear that?
Ron;We must be getting close.
Harry;Hold on.
Ron;Haaaarryyy!
Ron;Hold oonnn!!!
Ron;Take my hand!
Ron;Hold on!
Harry;I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
Harry;I think we found the train.
Ron;Yeah.
Ron;Welcome home.
Harry;Up! Up!
Ron;It's not working!
Harry;Up! Ron, mind that tree!
HarryAND Ron;Aaahhh! Aaah!
Ron;Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ron;My wand. Look at my wand.
Harry;Be thankful it's not your neck.
Ron;What's happening?
Harry;I don't know.
Harry;Come on, go! Fast!
Ron;Scabbers, you're okay.
Ron;The caaaar!
Ron;Dad's gonna kill me.
Harry;See you, Hedwig.
Harry;So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
Harry;we almost get killed by a tree...
Harry;Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Filch;Well, take a good look, lads.
Filch;This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
Filch;Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
Snape;You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
Snape;Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Snape;You have risked the exposure of our world.
Snape;Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.
Snape;that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Ron;Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
Snape;Silence.
Snape;I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... 
Snape;the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
Snape;As it is...
Dumbledore;They are not.
Harry;Professor Dumbledore.
Harry;Professor McGonagall.
Snape;Headmaster these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
Filch;As such...
Dumbledore;I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
Dumbledore;However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Ron;We'll go and get our stuff, then.
Mcgonagall;What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Ron;You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Mcgonagall;Not today, Mr. Weasley but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
Mcgonagall;I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.
Professor Sprout;Morning, everyone.
Professor Sprout;Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Professor Sprout;Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. 
Professor Sprout;Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. 
Professor Sprout;Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? 
Professor Sprout;Yes, Miss Granger.
Hermione;Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.
Hermione;It's also quite dangerous. 
Hermione;The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
Professor Sprout;Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
Professor Sprout;As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet.
Professor Sprout;But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs for auditory protection.
Professor Sprout;So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.
Professor Sprout;Flaps tight down, and watch me closely.
Professor Sprout;You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
Professor Sprout;You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
Professor Sprout;Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot
Professor Sprout;and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Professor Sprout;Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
Seamus;No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
Professor Sprout;Yes, well, just leave him there.
Professor Sprout;Right, on we go.
Professor Sprout;Plenty of pots to go around.
Professor Sprout;Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
Percy;Hello, Sir Nicolas.
Sir Nicholas;Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.
Ron;Say it. I'm doomed.
Harry;You're doomed.
Colin;Hi, Harry.
Colin;I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
Harry;Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Dean;Ron, is that your owl?
Ron;Bloody bird's a menace.
Seamus;Heads up, everyone. 
Seamus;Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
Neville;Go on, Ron. 
Neville;I ignored one from my gran once. 
Neville;It was horrible.
Mrs. Weasley;RonALD WEASLEY! 
Mrs. Weasley;HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!
Mrs. Weasley;I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! 
Mrs. Weasley;YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! 
Mrs. Weasley;IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!
Mrs. Weasley;And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.
Mrs. Weasley;Your father and I are so proud.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. 
Gilderoy Lockhart;Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award  
Gilderoy Lockhart;But I don't talk about that. 
Gilderoy Lockhart;I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Now, be warned.
Gilderoy Lockhart;It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
Gilderoy Lockhart;You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I must ask you not to scream.
Gilderoy Lockhart;It might provoke them.
Seamus;Cornish pixies?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Let's see what you make of them.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Come on now, round them up, round them up!
Gilderoy Lockhart;They're only pixies.
Neville;Please, get me down!
Hermione;Get off me!
Harry;Stop. Hold still!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
Gilderoy Lockhart;I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
Ron;What do we do now?
Hermione;Immobulus!
Neville;Why is it always me?
WOOD;I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.
WOOD;We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.
WOOD;What...? I don't believe it.
WOOD;Where you think you're going, Flint?
Flint;Quidditch practice.
WOOD;I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Flint;Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
Ron;I smell trouble.
WOOD;I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.
WOOD;You've got a new Seeker. Who?
Harry;Malfoy?
Draco;That's right.
Draco;And that's not all that's new this year.
Ron;Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
Ron;How did you get those?
Flint;A gift from Draco's father.
Draco;You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
Hermione;At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
Hermione;They got in on pure talent.
Draco;No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
Ron;You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Ron;Eat slugs!
Hermione;You okay, Ron?
Hermione;Say something.
Colin;Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
Harry;No, Colin, get out of the way.
Harry;Let's take him to Hagrid's.
Harry;He'll know what to do.
Hagrid;This calls for a specialist's equipment.
Hagrid;Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid.
Hagrid;Okay.
Hagrid;Better out than in.
Hagrid;Who was Rontrying to curse, anyway?
Harry;Malfoy. He called Hermione...
Harry;Well, I don't know exactly what it means.
Hermione;He called me a Mudblood.
Hagrid;He did not.
Harry;What's a Mudblood?
Hermione;"It means ""dirty blood."
Hermione;Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
Hermione;Someone with non-magic parents.
Hermione;Someone like me.
Hermione;It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Hagrid;See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.
Harry;That's horrible.
Ron;It's disgusting.
Hagrid;And it's codswallop to boot.
Hagrid;Dirty blood.
Hagrid;Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less.
Hagrid;More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.
Hagrid;Come here.
Hagrid;Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Hagrid;Don't you think on it for one minute.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Harry, Harry, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
Harry;Not really.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Remember that.
Voice;Come.
Voice;Come to me.
Harry;What?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Sorry?
Harry;That voice.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Voice?
Harry;Didn't you hear it?
Gilderoy Lockhart;What are you talking about, Harry?
Gilderoy Lockhart;I think you're getting a bit drowsy.
Gilderoy Lockhart;And great Scott, no wonder. 
Gilderoy Lockhart;Look at the time.
Gilderoy Lockhart;We've been here nearly four hours.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.
Harry;Spooky.
Voice;Blood.
Voice;I smell blood.
Voice;Let me rip you.
Voice;Let me kill you.
Voice;Kill!
Voice;Kill!
Voice;Kill!
Hermione;Harry!
Harry;Did you hear it?
Ron;Hear what?
Harry;That voice.
Hermione;Voice? What voice?
Harry;I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
Harry;And then again just...
Voice;It's time.
Harry;It's moving.
Harry;I think it's going to kill.
Ron;Kill?
Hermione;Harry, wait! Not so fast!
Harry;Strange.
Harry;I've never seen spiders act like that.
Ron;I don't like spiders.
Ron;What's that?
Hermione;"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. 
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
Hermione;Enemies of the Heir, beware.
Hermione;It's written in blood.
Harry;Oh, no.
Harry;It's Filch's cat.
Harry;It's Mrs. Norris.
Draco;Enemies of the Heir, beware.
Draco;You'll be next, Mudbloods.
Filch;What's going on here?
Filch;Go on. Make way, make way.
Filch;Potter?
Filch;What are you...?
Filch;Mrs. Norris?
Filch;You've murdered my cat.
Harry;No. No.
Filch;I'll kill you.
Filch;I'll kill you!
Dumbledore;Argus!
Dumbledore;Argus, I...
Dumbledore;Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
Dumbledore;Everyone except you three.
BOY;Ravenclaws, follow me.
Dumbledore;She's not dead, Argus.
Dumbledore;She has been Petrified.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Aghh! Thought so.
Gilderoy Lockhart;So unlucky I wasn't there.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
Dumbledore;But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say.
Filch;Ask him.
Filch;It's him that's done it.
Filch;You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry;It's not true, sir. I swear.
Harry;I never touched Mrs. Norris.
Filch;Rubbish.
Snape;If I might, headmaster?
Snape;Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Snape;However the circumstances are suspicious.
Snape;I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.
Gilderoy Lockhart;You see, Harrywas helping me answer my fan mail.
Hermione;That's why Ronand I went looking for him, professor.
Hermione;We'd just found him when he said...
Snape;Yes, Miss Granger?
Harry;When I said I wasn't hungry.
Harry;We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Dumbledore;Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
Filch;My cat has been Petrified.
Filch;I want to see some punishment!
Dumbledore;We will be able to cure her, Argus.
Dumbledore;As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.
Dumbledore;When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.
Dumbledore;And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.
Hermione;It's a bit strange, isn't it?
Harry;Strange?
Hermione;You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear...
Hermione;and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
Harry;Do you think I should have told them?
Harry;Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Ron;Are you mad?
Hermione;No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
PICTURE;She's right, you know.
Mcgonagall;Could I have your attention,please?
Mcgonagall;Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets.
Mcgonagall;Like so.
Mcgonagall;One, two, three. Vera Verto.
Mcgonagall;Now it's your turn.
Mcgonagall;Who would like to go first?
Mcgonagall;Ahh , Mr. Weasley.
Mcgonagall;One, two, three. Vera Verto.
Ron;Vera Verto!
Mcgonagall;That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley.
Mcgonagall;Yes, Miss Granger?
Hermione;Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
Mcgonagall;Very well.
Mcgonagall;You all know, of course that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:
Mcgonagall;Godric Gryffindor,
Mcgonagall;Helga Hufflepuff...
Mcgonagall;Rowena Ravenclaw
Mcgonagall;Salazar Slytherin.
Mcgonagall;Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.
Mcgonagall;One did not.
Ron;Three guesses who.
Mcgonagall;Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
Mcgonagall;He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
Mcgonagall;In other words, pure-bloods.
Mcgonagall;Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.
Mcgonagall;Now, according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the Chamber of Secrets.
Mcgonagall;Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.
Mcgonagall;The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Hermione;Muggle-borns.
Mcgonagall;Well , Naturally, the school has been searched many times.
Mcgonagall;No such chamber has been found.
Hermione;Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Mcgonagall;The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
Mcgonagall;It is said to be the home of a monster.
Ron;Do you think it's true?
Ron; Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Hermione;Yes. Couldn't you tell? 
Hermione;McGonagall's worried. 
Hermione;All the teachers are.
Harry;If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... 
Hermione;The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. 
Hermione;The question is, who is it?
Ron;Let's think. 
Ron;Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Hermione;If you're talking about Malfoy...
Ron;Of course. You heard him.
Ron;You'll be next, Mudbloods.
Hermione;I heard him.
Hermione;But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Harry;Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
Harry;I mean, look at his family.
Harry;The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Ron;Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Ron;Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione;Even they aren't that thick.
Hermione;But there might be another way.
Hermione;Mind you, it would be difficult.
Hermione;Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
Hermione;and it'll be dangerous.
Hermione;Very dangerous.
Hermione;Here it is.
Hermione;The Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione;Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.
Ron;You mean if Harryand I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Hermione;Yes 
Ron;Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
Hermione;Exactly.
Hermione;But it's tricky. 
Hermione;I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry;How long will it take to make?
Hermione;A month.
Harry;A month?
Harry;But, Hermione,
Harry;if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
Hermione;I know.
Hermione;But it's the only plan we've got.
Lee Jordan;Another goal for Slytherin!
Lee Jordan;They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
SLYTHERINS;Yeah! Yeah!
Draco;All right there, Scarhead?
WOOD;Watch yourself, Harry!
Harry;Wood, look out!
Hagrid;Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
Hagrid;That's been tampered with, that has.
Ron;I'll stop it.
Hermione;No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky.
Hermione;You could hit Harry.
Draco;Training for the ballet, Potter!!
Draco;You'll never catch me, Potter.
Hermione;Let's go.
Lee Jordan;HarryPotter has caught the Snitch.
Lee Jordan;Gryffindor wins!
Hermione;Finite Incantatem!
Harry;Thank you.
Hermione;Are you okay?
Harry;No. I think my arm is broken.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Not to worry, Harry. 
Gilderoy Lockhart;I will fix that arm of yours straight away.
Harry;No, Not you.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
Gilderoy Lockhart;This won't hurt a bit.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Brackium Emendo!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.
Hagrid;Broken? There's no bones left.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Much more flexible, though.
Madam Pomfrey;Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
Madam Pomfrey;You can go. Out of my way.
Madam Pomfrey;Should have been brought straight to me.
Madam Pomfrey;I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back...
Hermione;You will be able to, won't you?
Madam Pomfrey;I'll be able to, certainly.
Madam Pomfrey;But it'll be painful.
Madam Pomfrey;You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Madam Pomfrey;Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
Madam Pomfrey;What do you expect?
Madam Pomfrey;Pumpkin juice?
Voice;Kill. Kill.!!
Voice;Time to kill..
Dobby;Hello.
Harry;Dobby?
Dobby;HarryPotter should have listened to Dobby.
Dobby;HarryPotter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Harry;It was you. 
Harry;You stopped the barrier from letting Ronand me through.
Dobby;Indeed. Yes, sir.
Harry;You nearly got Ronand me expelled.
Dobby;At least you would be away from here.
Dobby;HarryPotter must go home.
Dobby;Dobbythought his Bludger would be enough to make HarryPotter see...
Harry;Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Dobby;Dobbyfeels most aggrieved, sir.
Dobby;Dobbyhad to iron his hands.
Harry;You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you.
Dobby;Dobbyis used to death threats, sir.
Dobby;Dobbygets them five times a day at home.
Harry;I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Dobby;Not kill you, sir.
Dobby;Never kill you.
Dobby;Dobbyremembers how it was before HarryPotter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Dobby;We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir.
Dobby;Of course, Dobbyis still treated like vermin.
Harry;Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
Dobby;This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.
Dobby;Dobbycan only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
Dobby;Listen.
Dobby;Listen!
Dobby;Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.
Dobby;HarryPotter must not stay here...now that history is to repeat itself.
Harry;Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Dobby;Oahh! I shouldn't have said that.
Dobby;Bad Dobby! Bad!
Harry;Stop it!
Harry;Stop it, Dobby!
Harry;Tell me Dobbywhen did this happen before?
Harry;Who's doing it now?
Dobby;Dobbycannot say, sir. 
Dobby;Dobbyonly wants HarryPotter to be safe.
Harry;No, Dobby. Tell me.
Harry;Who is it?
Madam Pomfrey;Put him here.
Madam Pomfrey;What happened?
Dumbledore;There's been another attack.
Mcgonagall;I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.
Mcgonagall;Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.
Mcgonagall;What can this mean, Albus?
Dumbledore;It means that our students are in great danger.
Mcgonagall;What should I tell the staff?
Dumbledore;The truth.
Dumbledore;Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
Dumbledore;It is as we feared, Minerva
Dumbledore;The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
Hermione;Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Ron;Of course.
Ron;Don't you see?
Ron;Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
Ron;Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Hermione;Maybe.
Hermione;We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Ron;Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Ron;Don't you think we'll get caught?
Hermione;No. No one ever comes in here.
Ron;Why?
Hermione;Moaning Myrtle.
Ron;Who?
Hermione;Moaning Myrtle.
Ron;Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Moaning Myrtle;I'm Moaning Myrtle.
Moaning Myrtle;I wouldn't expect you to know me.
Moaning Myrtle;Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable moping Moaning Myrtle? Aaaaaa…
Hermione;She's a little sensitive.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Gather round!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Gather round.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Can everybody see me?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Can you all hear me?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Excellent.
Gilderoy Lockhart;In light of the dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club to train you all up.
Gilderoy Lockhart;In case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions.
Gilderoy Lockhart;For full details, see my published works.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.
Gilderoy Lockhart;He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
Gilderoy Lockhart;You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.
Gilderoy Lockhart;One.Two. Three!
Snape;Expelliarmus!
Hermione;Do you think he's all right?
Ron;Who cares?
Gilderoy Lockhart;An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape...
Gilderoy Lockhart;but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do.
Gilderoy Lockhart;If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
Snape;Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor.
Gilderoy Lockhart;An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape..
Gilderoy Lockhart;Let's have a volunteer pair. 
Gilderoy Lockhart;Potter, Weasley, how about you?
Snape;Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
Snape;We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Snape;Might I suggest someone from my own house?
Snape;Malfoy, perhaps?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Good luck, Potter.
Harry;Thank you, sir.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Wands at the ready.
Draco;Scared, Potter?
Harry;You wish.
Gilderoy Lockhart;On the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.
Gilderoy Lockhart;We don't want any accidents here.
Gilderoy Lockhart;One. Two...
Draco;Everte Statum!
Harry;Rictusempra!
Gilderoy Lockhart;I said disarm only.
Draco;Serpensortia!
Snape;Don't move, Potter.
Snape;I'll get rid of it for you.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Allow me, Professor Snape.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Alarte Ascendare!
Snape;Vipera Evanesca.
Ron;You're a Parselmouth?
Ron;Why didn't you tell us?
Harry;I'm a what?
Hermione;You can talk to snakes.
Harry;I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Harry;Once. But so what?
Harry;I bet loads of people here can do it.
Hermione;No, they can't.
Hermione;It's not a very common gift, Harry.
Hermione;This is bad.
Harry;What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
Ron;That's what you said to it.
Harry;You were there. You heard me.
Ron;I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Ron;Snake language.
Harry;I spoke a different language?
Harry;But I didn't realize...
Harry;How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Hermione;I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.
Hermione;Harry, listen to me.
Hermione;There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
Hermione;Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
Hermione;He could talk to snakes too.
Ron;Exactly.
Ron;Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.
Harry;But I'm not.
Harry;I can't be.
Hermione;He lived a thousand years ago.
Hermione;For all we know, you could be.
Harry;I'll see you back in the common room.
Voice;I want blood.
Voice;They all must die.
Voice;Kill. Kill. Kill.
Voice;Time to kill.
Filch;Caught in the act.
Filch;I'll have you out this time, Potter.
Filch;Mark my words.
Harry;No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
Harry;Professor I swear I didn't.
Mcgonagall;This is out of my hands, Potter.
Mcgonagall;Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
Mcgonagall;Sherbet Lemon.
Harry;Professor Dumbledore?
SORTING HAT;Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
Harry;I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
SORTING HAT;Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.
SORTING HAT;But I stand by what I said last year.
SORTING HAT;You would have done well in Slytherin.
Harry;You're wrong.
Dumbledore;Harry?
Harry;Professor.
Harry;Your bird...There was nothing I could do.
Harry;He just caught fire.
Dumbledore;And about time too.
Dumbledore;He's been looking dreadful for days.
Dumbledore;Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
Dumbledore;Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Dumbledore;They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
Dumbledore;and then they are reborn from the ashes.
Dumbledore;Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
Dumbledore;They can carry immensely heavy loads.
Dumbledore;Their tears have healing powers.
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Hagrid;Wait! Listen!
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry.
Hagrid;I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.
Dumbledore;Hagriiid!! Relax.
Dumbledore;I do not believe that Harryattacked anyone.
Hagrid;Of course you don't.
Hagrid;Ohh! Oww! Right. Well, I'll...
Hagrid;I'll just wait outside, then.
Dumbledore;Yes.
Harry;You don't think it was me, professor?
Dumbledore;No, Harry. I do not think it was you.
Dumbledore;But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
Harry;No, sir. Nothing
Dumbledore;Very well, then.
Dumbledore;Off you go.
Hermione;Everything's set. 
Hermione;We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Harry;Crabbe and Goyle.
Hermione;We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
Ron;How?
Hermione;I've got it all worked out.
Hermione;I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Hermione;Simple, but powerful.
Hermione;Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms.
Ron;Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
Hermione;I've already got mine.
Hermione;Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
Hermione;I got this off her robes.
Hermione;I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione;Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Harry;Ron, maybe I should do it.
Ron;Yeah. Right.
Harry;Wingardium Leviosa.
Ron;How thick could you get?
Harry;Come on, let's get them.
Hermione;We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
Hermione;Add the hairs.
Ron;Essence of Crabbe.
Hermione;Cheers.
Ron;I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hermione;Me too.
Ron;Harry?
Harry;Ron.
Ron;Bloody hell!
Harry;We still sound like ourselves.
Harry;You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Ron;Bloody hell.
Harry;Excellent.
Ron;But where's Hermione?
Hermione;I...I don't think I'm going.
Hermione;You go on without me.
Harry;Hermione, are you okay?
Hermione;Just go. You're wasting time.
Harry;Come on.
Harry;I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
Percy;Excuse me.
Ron;What are you doing d...?
Ron;I mean, what are you doing down here?
Percy;I happen to be a school prefect.
Percy;You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night.
Percy;What are your names again?
Harry;I'm...
Draco;Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?
Draco;Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
Draco;Why are you wearing glasses?
Harry;Ah- um.. Reading.
Draco;Reading?
Draco;I didn't know you could read.
Draco;And what are you doing down here, Weasley?
Percy;Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
Draco;Well, sit down.
Draco;You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.
Draco;They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.
Draco;What's wrong with you, Crabbe?
Ron;Stomachache.
Draco;I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
Draco;I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
Draco;Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
Harry;You're wrong!
Draco;What?
Draco;You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Draco;Well? Do you?
Harry;HarryPotter?
Draco;Good one, Goyle.
Draco;You're absolutely right.
Draco;Saint Potter.
Draco;And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
Harry;But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Draco;You know I don't, Goyle.
Draco;I told you yesterday.
Draco;How many times do I have to tell you?
Draco;Is this yours?
Draco;But my father did say this:
Draco;It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.
Draco;He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Draco;Only that they were expelled.
Draco;The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.
Draco;So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
Draco;As for me I hope it's Granger.
Draco;What's the matter with you two?
Draco;You're acting very odd.
Harry;It's his stomachache.
Harry;Calm down.
Ron;Scar!
Harry;Hair!
Draco;Hey! Where are you going?
Ron;That was close.
Harry;Hermione, come out.
Harry;We've got loads to tell you.
Hermione;Go away.
Moaning Myrtle;Wait till you see. It's awful.
Harry;Hermione?
Harry;Are you okay?
Hermione;Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
Hermione;It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
Hermione;Look at my face.
Ron;Look at your tail.
Ron;Have you spoken to Hermione?
Harry;She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
Harry;What's this?
Ron;Yuck!
Harry;Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Moaning Myrtle;Ohh-Uhh..Come to throw something else at me?
Harry;Why would I throw something at you?
Moaning Myrtle;Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
Ron;But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
Ron;I mean, it'll just go right through you.
Moaning Myrtle;SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.
Moaning Myrtle;Ten points if you get it through her stomach!
Moaning Myrtle;Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Harry;But who threw it at you, anyway?
Moaning Myrtle;I don't know. I didn't see them.
Moaning Myrtle;I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head.
Moaning Myrtle;Whoo-oooh-whoooo...
Harry;"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
Harry;My name is HarryPotter.
Diary;Hello HarryPotter, my name is Tom Riddle.
Harry;Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
Diary;Yes.
Harry;Can you tell me?
Diary;No. But I can show you.
Diary;Let me take you back fifty years ago.
Diary;13th June..
Harry;Excuse me. 
Harry;Could you tell me what's going on here?
Harry;Are you Tom Riddle?
Harry;Hello, can you hear me?
Dumbledore;Riddle! Come.
Tom Riddle;Professor Dumbledore.
Harry;Dumbledore?
Dumbledore;It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.
Tom Riddle;Yes, professor. I suppose I...
Tom Riddle;I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
Dumbledore;I'm afraid they are, Tom.
Dumbledore;They are true.
Tom Riddle;About the school as well?
Tom Riddle;I don't have a home to go to.
Tom Riddle;They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?
Dumbledore;I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
Tom Riddle;Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught...
Dumbledore;Is there something you wish to tell me?
Tom Riddle;No, sir. Nothing.
Dumbledore;Very well, then. Off you go.
Tom Riddle;Good night, sir.
Hagrid;Let's get you out of there.
Tom Riddle;Evening, Hagrid.
Tom Riddle;I'm going to have to turn you in Hagrid
Tom Riddle;I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...
Hagrid;You can't. You don't understand.
Tom Riddle;The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. 
Tom Riddle;The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Hagrid;It wasn't him.
Hagrid;Aragog never killed no one. Never.
Tom Riddle;Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.
Tom Riddle;Now, stand aside.
Hagrid;No!
Tom Riddle;Stand aside, Hagrid.
Hagrid;No!
Tom Riddle;Cistem Aperio!
Tom Riddle;Arania Exumai!
Hagrid;Aragog! Aragog!
Tom Riddle;I can't let you go.
Tom Riddle;They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
Tom Riddle;You'll be expelled.
Harry;Hagrid!
Harry;HAAGRIIID!
Harry;Wow!
Harry;It was Hagrid. 
Harry;Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
Hermione;It can't be Hagrid.
Hermione;It just can't be.
Ron;We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
Ron;He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.
Harry;The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
Harry;What would any of us have done?
Hermione;Look, Hagrid's our friend. 
Hermione;Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
Ron;That would be a cheerful visit.
Ron;"Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Hagrid;Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?
Harry-Ron-Hermione;No.
Harry;What's that you've got, Hagrid?
Hagrid;It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Hagrid;For the Mandrakes, you know.
Hagrid;Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do.
Hagrid;But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them. and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.
Hagrid;In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves.
Hagrid;All right?
Hagrid;Hello, Neville.
Neville;Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.
Neville;Come on!
Hermione;It had to be a Gryffindor.
Hermione;Nobody else knows our password.
Hermione;Unless it wasn't a student.
Ron;Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.
Harry;And they found it.
Harry;Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
WOOD;All right, listen up.
WOOD;We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
WOOD;We're stronger, quicker and smarter.
Fred;Not to mention they're dead scared that Harrywill Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
WOOD;Well, that too.
WOOD;Professor McGonagall.
Mcgonagall;This match has been canceled.
WOOD;We can't cancel Quidditch.
Mcgonagall;Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.
Mcgonagall;Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.
Mcgonagall;There's something the both of you have to see.
Mcgonagall;I warn you.
Mcgonagall;This could be a wee bit of a shock.
Ron;Hermione!
Mcgonagall;She was found near the library along with this.
Mcgonagall;Does it mean anything to either of you?
Harry;No.
Mcgonagall;Could I have your attention, please?
Mcgonagall;Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately:
Mcgonagall;"All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening."
Mcgonagall;All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
Mcgonagall;No exceptions.
Mcgonagall;I should tell you this:
Mcgonagall;Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed.
Harry;We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
Harry;I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
Ron;But you heard McGonagall.
Ron;We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Harry;I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
Hagrid;Who's there?
Hagrid;Hello? Hello?
Harry;What's that for?
Hagrid;Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in.
Hagrid;I just made a pot of tea.
Harry;Hagrid, are you okay?
Hagrid;I'm fine. I'm all right.
Harry;Did you hear about Hermione?
Hagrid;Oh yeah. I heard about that, all right.
Harry;Look, we have to ask you something.
Harry;Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Hagrid;What you had to understand about that is...
Hagrid;Quick, under the cloak.
Hagrid;Don't say a word.
Hagrid;Be quiet, both of you.
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Dumbledore;Good evening, Hagrid.
Dumbledore;I wonder, could we...?
Hagrid;Of course. Come in. Come in.
Ron;That's Dad's boss.
Ron;Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
FUDGE;Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
FUDGE;Had to come.
FUDGE;Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
FUDGE;Things have gone far enough.
FUDGE;The Ministry's got to act.
Hagrid;But I never...
Hagrid;You know I never, professor.
Dumbledore;I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence.
FUDGE;Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him.
FUDGE;I've got to take him.
Hagrid;Take me? Take me where?
Hagrid;Not Azkaban prison.
FUDGE;I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
Lucius Malfoy;Already here, Fudge?
Lucius Malfoy;Good.
Hagrid;What are you doing here?
Hagrid;Get out of my house!
Lucius Malfoy;Believe me I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...
Lucius Malfoy;You call this a house?
Lucius Malfoy;No.
Lucius Malfoy;I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
Dumbledore;Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
Lucius Malfoy;The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.
Lucius Malfoy;This is an order of suspension.
Lucius Malfoy;You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
Lucius Malfoy;I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
Lucius Malfoy;Well, what, with all these attacks there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
Lucius Malfoy;I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
Hagrid;You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.
Hagrid;Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.
Hagrid;You mark my words, there'll be killings next!
Lucius Malfoy;You think so?
Dumbledore;Calm yourself, Hagrid.
Dumbledore;If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside.
Dumbledore;However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
Lucius Malfoy;Admirable sentiments.
Lucius Malfoy;Shall we?
Lucius Malfoy;Fudge.
FUDGE;Come, Hagrid.
Hagrid;Well? If...
Hagrid;If anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
Hagrid;Yep. That would lead them right.
Hagrid;That's all I have to say.
Hagrid;And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.
FUDGE;Good boy.
Ron;Hagrid's right.
Ron;With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
Harry;Look.
Harry;Come on.
Harry;Come on, Fang.
Harry;Come on.
Ron;What?
Harry;You heard what Hagrid said.
Harry;Follow the spiders.
Ron;They're heading to the Dark Forest.
Ron;"Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""?"
Ron;Harry, I don't like this.
Ron;Harry, I don't like this at all.
Harry;Shush!
Ron;Can we go back now?
Harry;Come on.
Aragog;Who is it?
Harry;Don't panic.
Aragog;Hagrid?
Aragog;Is that you?
Harry;We're friends of Hagrid's.
Harry;And you?
Harry;You're Aragog, aren't you?
Aragog;Yes.
Aragog;Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
Harry;He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.
Harry;They think it's Hagrid.
Harry;They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
Aragog;That's a lie.
Aragog;Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry;Then you're not the monster?
Aragog;No.
Aragog;The monster was born in the castle.
Aragog;I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.
Ron;Harry.
Harry;But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
Aragog;We do not speak of it.
Aragog;It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
Harry;But have you seen it?
Aragog;I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
Aragog;The girl was discovered in a bathroom.
Aragog;When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.
Ron;Harry!
Harry;What?
Harry;Well, thank you.
Harry;We'll just go.
Aragog;Go?
Aragog;I think not.
Aragog;My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.
Aragog;But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
Aragog;Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Ron;Can we panic now?
Ron;Know any spells?
Harry;One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Ron;Where's Hermione when you need her?
Harry;Let's go!
Harry;Arania Exumai!
Harry;Go!
Ron;Glad we're out of there.
Harry;Arania Exumai!
Ron;Thanks for that.
Harry;Don't mention it.
Harry;Get us out of here.
Harry;Now!
Harry;Come on!
Harry;Come on, move faster!
Harry;Come on! Go!
Harry;Get us in the air.
Ron;The flying gear's jammed!
Harry;Come on! Pull!
Ron;I'm trying!
Ron;Follow the spiders!
Ron;Follow the spiders.
Ron;If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.
Ron;I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?
Ron;What have we found out?
Harry;We know one thing.
Harry;Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry;He was innocent.
Harry;Wish you were here, Hermione.
Harry;We need you.
Harry;Now more than ever.
Ron;What's that?
Harry;Ron...
Harry;This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
Harry;Come on.
Harry;"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk."
Harry;Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
Harry;Spiders flee before it.
Harry;Ron, this is it.
Harry;The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
Harry;That's why I can hear it speak.
Harry;It's a snake.
Ron;But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Harry;Because no one did look it in the eye.
Harry;Not directly, at least.
Harry;Colin saw it through his camera.
Harry;Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Harry;Nick got the full blast of it.
Harry;But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.
Harry;And Hermione had the mirror.
Harry;I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
Ron;And Mrs. Norris?
Ron;I'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, Harry.
Harry;The water.
Harry;There was water on the floor that night.
Harry;She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
Harry;Spiders flee before it.
Harry;It all fits.
Ron;How's a basilisk been getting around?
Ron;A dirty, great snake.
Ron;Someone would have seen it.
Harry;Hermione's answered that too.
Ron;Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
Harry;Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
Harry;She died in a bathroom?
Harry;What if she never left?
Ron;Moaning Myrtle.
Mcgonagall;All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
Mcgonagall;All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.
Mcgonagall;As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.
Mcgonagall;Our worst fear has been realized.
Mcgonagall;A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
Mcgonagall;The students must be sent home.
Mcgonagall;I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Gilderoy Lockhart;So sorry. Dozed off.
Gilderoy Lockhart;What have I missed?
Snape;A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. 
Snape;Your moment has come at last.
Gilderoy Lockhart;My moment?
Snape;Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Mcgonagall;That's settled. 
Mcgonagall;We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.
Mcgonagall;Your skills, after all, are legend.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Very well.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I'll just be in my office getting...
Gilderoy Lockhart;Getting ready.
Madam Pomfrey;Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?
Mcgonagall;Ginny Weasley.
Ron;Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
Ron;Ginny.
Harry;Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.
Harry;At least we can tell him what we know.
Harry;Professor, we have some information for you.
Harry;Are you going somewhere?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Got to go.
Ron;What about my sister?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Well… Aemm…
Gilderoy Lockhart;As to that, most unfortunate.
Gilderoy Lockhart;No one regrets more than I.
Ron;You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
Ron;You can't go now.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description...
Harry;You're running away?
Harry;After all you did in your books?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Books can be misleading.
Harry;You wrote them.
Gilderoy Lockhart;My dear boy, use your common sense.
Gilderoy Lockhart;My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.
Harry;You're a fraud.
Harry;You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
Ron;Is there anything you can do?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Yes, now you mention it.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.
Gilderoy Lockhart;I'd never have sold another book.
Gilderoy Lockhart;In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.
Harry;Don't even think about it.
Moaning Myrtle;Who's there?
Moaning Myrtle;Hello, Harry.
Moaning Myrtle;What do you want?
Harry;To ask you how you died.
Moaning Myrtle;It was dreadful.
Moaning Myrtle;It happened right here in this very cubicle.
Moaning Myrtle;I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
Moaning Myrtle;I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
Harry;Who was it, Myrtle?
Moaning Myrtle;I don't know. I was distraught!
Moaning Myrtle;But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.
Moaning Myrtle;And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died.
Harry;Just like that? How?
Moaning Myrtle;I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes over there by that sink.
Harry;This is it.
Harry;This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Ron;Say something. 
Ron;Harrysay something in Parseltongue!
Gilderoy Lockhart;Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Well, then, I'll just be...
Gilderoy Lockhart;There's no need for me to stay.
Harry;Yes, there is.
Harry;You first.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Now, boys, what good will it do?
Ron;Better you than us.
Gilderoy Lockhart;But... Obviously, yes.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Sure you don't want to test it first?
Gilderoy Lockhart;It's really quite filthy down here.
Harry;All right. Let's go.
Moaning Myrtle;Oh, Harry?
Moaning Myrtle;If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
Harry;Thanks, Myrtle.
Harry;Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
Ron;Go on.
Harry;This way.
Ron;What's this?
Gilderoy Lockhart;It looks like a snake.
Harry;It's a snake skin.
Ron;Bloody hell.
Ron;Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.
Ron;Heart of a lion, this one.
Gilderoy Lockhart;The adventure ends here, boys.
Gilderoy Lockhart;But don't fret.
Gilderoy Lockhart;The world will know our story.
Gilderoy Lockhart;How I was too late to save the girl.
Gilderoy Lockhart;How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body.
Gilderoy Lockhart;So...You first, Mr. Potter.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Say goodbye to your memories.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Obliviate!
Ron;Harry! Harry
Harry;Ron! Ron, are you okay?
Ron;I'm fine.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Hello. Who are you?
Ron;RonWeasley.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Really?
Gilderoy Lockhart;And who am I?
Ron;Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
Ron;He hasn't got a clue who he is.
Gilderoy Lockhart;It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
Gilderoy Lockhart;Do you live here?
Ron;No.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Really?
Ron;What do I do now?
Harry;You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
Harry;I'll go on and find Ginny.
Ron;Okay.
Harry;Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Harry;Wake up, wake up.
Harry;Please wake up.
Tom Riddle;She won't wake.
Harry;Tom. Tom Riddle.
Harry;What do you mean, she won't wake?
Harry;She's not...?
Tom Riddle;She's still alive, but only just.
Harry;Are you a ghost?
Tom Riddle;A memory preserved in a diary for 50 years.
Harry;She's cold as ice.
Harry;Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.
Harry;You've got to help me, Tom.
Harry;There's a basilisk.
Tom Riddle;It won't come until it's called.
Harry;Give me my wand, Tom.
Tom Riddle;You won't be needing it.
Harry;We've got to go. We've got to save her.
Tom Riddle;I'm afraid I can't do that.
Tom Riddle;You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.
Tom Riddle;Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry;No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
Tom Riddle;It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
Harry;But why?
Tom Riddle;Because I told her to.
Tom Riddle;You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Tom Riddle;Not that she knew what she was doing.
Tom Riddle;She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Tom Riddle;Still, the power of the diary began to scare her.
Tom Riddle;She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.
Tom Riddle;And then who should find it but you?
Tom Riddle;The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Harry;And why did you want to meet me?
Tom Riddle;I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.
Tom Riddle;So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
Harry;Hagrid's my friend.
Harry;And you framed him, didn't you?
Tom Riddle;It was my word against Hagrid's.
Tom Riddle;Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry;I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Tom Riddle;He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
Tom Riddle; I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day
Tom Riddle;I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Harry;Well, you haven't finished it this time.
Harry;In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.
Harry;And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Tom Riddle;Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
Tom Riddle;For many months now, my new target has been you.
Tom Riddle;How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
Tom Riddle;How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Harry;Why do you care how I escaped?
Harry;Voldemort was after your time.
Tom Riddle;Voldemort is my past, present and future.
Harry;You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
Harry;You're Voldemort.
Tom Riddle;Surely you didn't think .I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
Tom Riddle;No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Harry;Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Tom Riddle;Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
Harry;He'll never be gone. 
Harry;Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
Harry;Fawkes?
Tom Riddle;So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
Tom Riddle;A songbird and an old hat.
Tom Riddle;Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous HarryPotter.
Tom Riddle;Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. 
Tom Riddle;It only obeys me.
Tom Riddle;No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you.
Tom Riddle;Yes, Potter.
Tom Riddle;The process is nearly complete.
Tom Riddle;In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory.
Tom Riddle;Lord Voldemort will return .very much alive.
Harry;Ginny?
Tom Riddle;Remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
Tom Riddle;I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
Tom Riddle;You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
Tom Riddle;Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
Tom Riddle;What are you doing?
Tom Riddle;Stop. No!
Harry;Ginny?
GINNY;Harry, It was me.
GINNY;But I swear, I didn't mean to.
GINNY;Riddle made me, and...
GINNY;Harry, you're hurt.
Harry;Don't worry.
Harry;Ginny, you need to get yourself out.
Harry;Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
Harry;You were brilliant, Fawkes.
Harry;I just wasn't quick enough.
Harry;Of course.
Harry;Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Harry;Thanks.
Harry;It's all right, Ginny.
Harry;It's over.
Harry;It's just a memory.
Gilderoy Lockhart;Amazing!
Gilderoy Lockhart;This is just like magic!
Dumbledore;You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
HarryAND Ron;Yes, sir.
Dumbledore;There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
HarryAND Ron;Yes, sir.
Dumbledore;Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
Ron;Thanks, sir.
Dumbledore;Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.
Dumbledore;I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
Dumbledore;Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry.
Dumbledore;You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Dumbledore;Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
Dumbledore;And second I sense that something is troubling you.
Dumbledore;Am I right, Harry?
Harry;It's just...
Harry;You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...
Harry;Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
Dumbledore;I see.
Dumbledore;Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?
Dumbledore;Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
Dumbledore;If I'm not mistaken, Harryhe transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
Harry;Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
Dumbledore;Not intentionally but yes.
Harry;So the Sorting Hat was right.
Harry;I should be in Slytherin.
Dumbledore;It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
Dumbledore;Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.
Dumbledore;Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Harry;Because I asked it to.
Dumbledore;Exactly, Harry. Exactly.
Dumbledore;Which makes you different from Voldemort.
Dumbledore;It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
Dumbledore;It is our choices.
Dumbledore;If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
Dumbledore;Be careful.
Harry;Godric Gryffindor.
Dumbledore;It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Harry;Dobby.
Harry;So this is your master.
Harry;The family you serve is the Malfoys.
Lucius Malfoy;I'll deal with you later.
Lucius Malfoy;Out of my way, Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;So it's true. You have returned.
Dumbledore;When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
Lucius Malfoy;Ridiculous.
Dumbledore;Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
Lucius Malfoy;How dare you!
Dumbledore;Beg your pardon?
Lucius Malfoy;My sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and, of course, its students.
Lucius Malfoy;The culprit has been identified, I presume?
Dumbledore;Yes.
Lucius Malfoy;And?
Lucius Malfoy;Who was it?
Dumbledore;Voldemort.
Dumbledore;Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
Lucius Malfoy;I see.
Dumbledore;Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.
Dumbledore;One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
Dumbledore;The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
Lucius Malfoy;Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Harry;Don't worry. I will be.
Lucius Malfoy;Dumbledore.
Lucius Malfoy;Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Harry;Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
Harry;Mr. Malfoy.
Harry;Mr. Malfoy!
Harry;I have something of yours.
Lucius Malfoy;Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Harry;I think you do, sir.
Harry;I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
Lucius Malfoy;You do, do you?
Lucius Malfoy;Why don't you prove it?
Lucius Malfoy;Come, Dobby.
Harry;Open it.
Lucius Malfoy;Dobby.
Dobby;Master has given Dobbya sock.
Lucius Malfoy;What? I didn't give...
Dobby;Master has presented Dobbywith clothes.
Dobby;Dobbyis free.
Lucius Malfoy;You lost me my servant!
Dobby;You shall not harm HarryPotter.
Lucius Malfoy;Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
Lucius Malfoy;Mark my words, Potter.
Lucius Malfoy;One day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.
Dobby;HarryPotter freed Dobby.
Dobby;How can Dobbyever repay him?
Harry;Just promise me something.
Dobby;Anything, sir.
Harry;Never try to save my life again.
Studente;Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
Sir Nicholas;Thank you.
Studente;Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
Sir Nicholas;Good evening.
Studente;Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
Sir Nicholas;Thank you.
Sir Nicholas;Hello.
Sir Nicholas;Hermione! Welcome back.
Hermione;Thanks, Sir Nicholas.
Neville;Harry. It's Hermione.
Ron;Welcome back, Hermione.
Hermione;It's good to be back.
Hermione;Congratulations.
Hermione;I can't believe you solved it.
Harry;We had loads of help from you.
Harry;We couldn't have done it without you.
Hermione;Thanks.
Mcgonagall;Could I have your attention, please?
Dumbledore;Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified.
Dumbledore;Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled.
Hermione;Oh, no.
Hagrid;Sorry I'm late.
Hagrid;The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
Hagrid;Some ruddy bird called Errol.
Hagrid;And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harryand Ronand Hermione, of course I would still be you-know-where so I'd just like to say thanks.
Harry;There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
